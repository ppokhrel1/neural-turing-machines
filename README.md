Neural Turing Machines
======================

Although the controller is vaguely implemented, it still provides for the multi layer feedforward network. I have tried to implement protein structure prediction along with the few other adventures described in the paper.
I will continue to update it.

The theano_toolkit was taken from somewhere in github. I forgot where it was.

## Usage
```
python train_copy.py [output_model_file]
```
```
python hp_prediction.py [output_file]
```
Any Suggestions or criticisms, please let me know.
